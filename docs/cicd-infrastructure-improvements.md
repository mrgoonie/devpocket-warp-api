### Service Dependencies

**PostgreSQL Test Database**:
```yaml
postgres:
  image: postgres:15
  env:
    POSTGRES_USER: test
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test
    POSTGRES_DB: devpocket_test
  ports:
    - 5433:5432
  options: >-
    --health-cmd "pg_isready -U test -d devpocket_test"
    --health-interval 10s
    --health-timeout 5s
    --health-retries 10
```

**Redis Cache Service**:
```yaml
redis:
  image: redis:7-alpine
  ports:
    - 6380:6379
  options: >-
    --health-cmd "redis-cli ping"
    --health-interval 10s
    --health-timeout 5s
    --health-retries 10
```

### Environment Configuration

**Test Environment Variables**:
```bash
ENVIRONMENT=test
TESTING=true
APP_DEBUG=true
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@localhost:5433/devpocket_test
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6380
JWT_SECRET_KEY=test_secret_key_for_testing_only
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
