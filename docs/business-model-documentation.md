# DevPocket Business Model & Subscription Tiers

## Overview

DevPocket operates on a freemium business model with a unique **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** approach for AI services. This model provides high gross margins (85-98%) while offering transparent, cost-effective AI features to users.

## BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Model

### Core Concept

Instead of reselling AI services at marked-up rates, DevPocket uses a BYOK model where users provide their own OpenRouter API keys for AI functionality. This approach offers several advantages:

#### For Users
- **Transparent Pricing**: Pay OpenRouter directly at cost (typically $0.001-0.01 per request)
- **No AI Markup**: Avoid 300-500% markups common in other services
- **Usage Control**: Direct control over AI spending and usage limits
- **Provider Choice**: Access to 100+ AI models through OpenRouter
- **Privacy**: Your API key, your data ownership

#### For DevPocket
- **High Margins**: 85-98% gross margins on subscription revenue
- **Scalable**: No AI infrastructure costs or rate limiting concerns
- **Sustainable**: Predictable revenue without variable AI costs
- **Competitive**: Can offer AI features at lower total cost than competitors

```

#### Getting Started with BYOK

1. **Obtain OpenRouter API Key**
   - Visit [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
   - Create account and generate API key
   - Add credits to your OpenRouter account

2. **Validate Key in DevPocket**
   ```bash
   POST /api/ai/validate-key
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
   
   {
     "openrouter_api_key": "sk-or-v1-xxx"
   }
   ```

3. **Use AI Features**
   - Command suggestions
   - Error analysis and solutions
   - Natural language to command translation
   - Code explanation and optimization

#### Cost Examples

| AI Feature | OpenRouter Cost | Traditional Service | Savings |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Command Suggestion | $0.001 | $0.05 | 98% |
| Error Analysis | $0.002 | $0.10 | 98% |
| Code Review | $0.005 | $0.25 | 98% |
| Documentation | $0.008 | $0.40 | 98% |

*Costs based on average request complexity and current OpenRouter pricing*

### Feature Gating

The API implements feature gating based on subscription tiers:

```python
# Example endpoint with tier checking
@router.get("/ssh/profiles")
async def list_ssh_profiles(
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Check subscription tier
    subscription = await get_user_subscription(current_user.id, db)
    
    profiles = await get_ssh_profiles(current_user.id, db)
    
    # Apply tier limits
    if subscription.tier == "free":
        profiles = profiles[:3]  # Limit to 3 profiles
    
    return {
        "profiles": profiles,
        "tier_info": {
            "current_tier": subscription.tier,
            "limit": 3 if subscription.tier == "free" else -1,
