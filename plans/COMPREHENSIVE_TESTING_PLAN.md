### Implementation Guidelines

#### Test Writing Standards

**Unit Test Requirements**:

- Mock only external services (OpenRouter, etc.)
- Validate end-to-end workflows

**Service Test Requirements**:
- Test business logic thoroughly
- Mock infrastructure dependencies
- Test error handling and edge cases
