## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Quality Standards
- **Unit Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% for new tests
- **Integration Test Coverage:** Key workflows and error paths
- **Mock Usage:** External dependencies (paramiko, redis, databases)
- **Performance Testing:** Critical path components
- **Documentation:** Test purpose and scenarios clearly documented

### Development Process
1. **Pre-Implementation:** Write failing tests first (TDD approach)
2. **Implementation:** Focus on covering missing statements
3. **Validation:** Verify coverage gains with each commit
4. **Code Review:** Peer review for test quality and completeness
5. **CI Integration:** Automated coverage reporting and thresholds

### Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Implementation:** Small, focused PRs per component
- **Regression Testing:** Maintain existing test stability
- **Performance Monitoring:** Ensure tests don't slow CI significantly
- **Documentation Updates:** Keep test documentation current
